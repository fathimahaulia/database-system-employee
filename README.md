# Employee Database Implementation using Java and SQL Server

A database system is essential, including for entrepreneurs, to track the data within their business. With the advancement of IT for designing database systems, companies will be greatly assisted in making business processes more efficient, particularly in the administrative recapitulation of a company. 
One of the institutions that requires a database system is the administration of a company. Hence, we developed a database to manage the administration of PT Meong Sejahtera (Meong Sejahtera Company) to collect data on Employees, Skills, Divisions, Work Programs, and Employee Ranks. This is done to facilitate service processes and the search for spare parts data.
The database system developed is expected to handle data management, including insert, update, delete, view/display, and data restoration. Additionally, to streamline the process of inputting data into the database and recording changes made in the database system, a login system was created for the database admin who can have editing access to the database.

# Methodology
## Database Design
In designing a database, there will be two steps:
\enum{Conceptual Database Design} which includes: identify entity's atributes and entity relations
\enum{Physical Database Design} which includes: implementing data model to DBMS (Database Management System)

## Connecting Database to Interface
If the database and workflow have been properly designed, the database can be connected to NetBeans using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). In this project, the Java ANT programming language is used.
